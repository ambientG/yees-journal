### How to Add Photos:
1. Create a 'photos' folder in your journal directory
2. Save your photos with clear names (e.g., photo1.jpg)
3. Update the photo paths above with your actual photo names
4. Add a title and description for each photo

*Tip: You can drag and drop photos directly into your text editor for some editors*
